## Innovation in This Project

The decision-first approach serves as the primary innovative aspect of this project. 
The assistant evaluates user readiness to apply for jobs instead of creating resumes and cover letters.

The new perspective helps entry-level workers because they need assistance to evaluate their own skills.

## Why This Approach Is Unique

- The system centers on assessing user readiness instead of measuring their speed of work.
- The system requires users to conduct self-evaluation through honest assessment.
- The system offers users guidance which prevents them from receiving an automatic rejection.
- The system operates through basic logical components which enable users to comprehend its workings.

## Future Enhancements

The system will support the following future development plans: 
- The system will create recommendations for skills that users need to develop.
- The system will provide users with capabilities to compare their resume keywords
- The system will provide users with a complete online platform for accessing its functions.
- The system will provide users with the choice to receive feedback that artificial intelligence generates.

The system maintains its original system design while users can implement these additional functions.
