## Innovation in This Project

The innovation of this project lies in its decision-first approach.

Instead of generating resumes or cover letters,
the assistant helps users evaluate readiness
before applying for a job.

This mindset shift is especially useful for beginners,
who often struggle with self-assessment.

## Why This Approach Is Unique

- Focuses on readiness, not speed
- Encourages honest self-reflection
- Provides guidance instead of rejection
- Uses simple and transparent logic

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements include:
- Skill gap suggestions
- Resume keyword comparison
- Web-based user interface
- Optional AI-driven feedback

These features can be added without changing the core structure.
