## Interview Guidance for Partial Readiness

Not all applicants fall into clear “ready” or “not ready” categories.
Many candidates have partial knowledge and are still learning.

Rejecting such applicants outright is discouraging and unrealistic.

## Guidance Strategy

When a user falls into the partially ready category,
the system provides practical interview preparation guidance such as:
- Revising core concepts
- Being transparent about learning stage
- Preparing examples from small projects
- Practicing basic interview questions

This guidance helps users approach interviews
with confidence and honesty rather than fear.
