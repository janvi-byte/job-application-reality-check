## System Architecture Overview

The project implements a straightforward modular system design which enables users 
to achieve complete comprehension of the system through its clear and readable design.

The system is divided into three main layers:

1. User Interaction Layer
2. Evaluation Logic Layer
3. Documentation Layer

## Component Breakdown

- `main.py`
  The main.py file allows users to operate the system by providing methods which enable them to collect input and view output results.

- `evaluation.py`
   The evaluation.py file contains all essential functions which enable users to evaluate their confidence levels and make decisions about their skills.

- `docs/`
 The docs/ folder stores all design documents research materials and project records.


## Data Flow

User Input
→ Skill Confidence Evaluation
→ Readiness Percentage Calculation
→ Decision & Guidance Output

The system design achieves easy maintenance and extension through its design
which divides logical elements from parts which explain system functionality.
