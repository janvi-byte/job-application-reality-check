# Problem Identification

Many applicants list skills such as Java or Frontend while applying
for jobs, even when they are still beginners.
This often results in rejections and low confidence.

Most tools help users apply for jobs,
but very few help them decide whether they are actually ready.

# Project Idea

This project works as a reality check for job applicants.
It evaluates readiness based on skill confidence
and provides guidance instead of blind encouragement.
