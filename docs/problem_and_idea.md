## Problem Identification

In the current job application process, many students and freshers
apply to roles by matching keywords from job descriptions.
If a job mentions "Java" or "Frontend", applicants often assume
they are suitable even if they have only basic or beginner-level knowledge.

This leads to several problems:
- Frequent rejections
- Loss of confidence
- Poor interview experiences
- Lack of clarity on skill readiness

Most existing tools focus on helping users apply faster,
but they rarely help users evaluate whether they are ready to apply.

## Core Idea of the Project

The idea of this project is to shift the focus from application generation
to readiness evaluation.

Instead of asking “Can I apply?”, the project asks:
“Am I prepared enough to apply?”

By combining skill requirements with self-assessed confidence levels,
the assistant provides a more realistic and honest evaluation for beginners.
