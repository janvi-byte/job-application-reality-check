## Problem Identification

The job application process needs improvement because students and freshers
use job description keywords to find suitable roles. Applicants who see "Java" or "Frontend"
in job descriptions assume they qualify for positions, even when their expertise remains at a fundamental level.

The situation produces multiple issues which include:
- Frequent rejections
- Loss of confidence
- Poor interview experiences
- Lack of clarity on skill readiness

Most existing tools focus on helping users apply faster, 
but they rarely help users evaluate whether they are ready to apply.

## Core Idea of the Project

The project aims to change its emphasis from generating applications 
towards evaluating applicant readiness for their assessments.

The project uses the question "Am I prepared enough to apply?" 
instead of its original question "Can I apply?"

The assistant combines skill requirements with self-assessed confidence 
levels to deliver beginners a complete and authentic assessment.
