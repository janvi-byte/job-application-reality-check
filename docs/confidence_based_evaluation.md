## Why Confidence-Based Evaluation Matters

In job applications, skill names alone do not reflect real ability.
Two applicants may list the same skill but have very different
levels of understanding.

For example:
- One person may have completed projects in Java
- Another may have only attended introductory lectures

This project addresses this gap by introducing confidence-based evaluation.

## Evaluation Method

Each skill is rated on a fixed scale:
- 0: Just started learning
- 1: Basic understanding
- 2: Comfortable with concepts
- 3: Strong practical knowledge

This method encourages honest self-evaluation
and reduces overconfidence during applications.
