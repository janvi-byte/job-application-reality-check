## Why Confidence-Based Evaluation Matters
Job applicants demonstrate their actual competencies through skill names which they present.
The same skill can be listed by two applicants who possess different levels of knowledge about the subject.

For example:
-> One person may have completed projects in Java
-> Another may have only attended introductory lectures


The project presents a solution to this problem through its introduction of confidence-based assessment methods.

## Evaluation Method

Each skill is rated on a fixed scale:
  0: Just started learning
  1: Basic understanding
  2: Comfortable with concepts
  3: Strong practical knowledge

The method encourages applicants to evaluate themselves honestly 
while it prevents them from displaying excessive self-confidence during application processes.
