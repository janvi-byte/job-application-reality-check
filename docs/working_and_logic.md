# Detailed Working of the System

The system works in a step-by-step manner and avoids
complex algorithms to maintain transparency.

# Step 1: Skill Input
The user enters the skills required for a job role
as mentioned in the job description.

# Step 2: Confidence Rating
For each skill, the user rates their confidence
on a scale from 0 to 3.
This reflects the user's honest self-assessment.

# Step 3: Score Aggregation
Each confidence value contributes to a total score.
The maximum possible score depends on the number of required skills.

# Step 4: Readiness Calculation
The readiness percentage is calculated using:
(total confidence score / maximum possible score) × 100

# Step 5: Decision Making
Based on the percentage, the system categorizes the user into:
- Ready to apply
- Partially ready (needs preparation)
- Not ready yet

This structured flow keeps the logic simple and reliable.
