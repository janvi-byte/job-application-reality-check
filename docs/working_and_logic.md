# Detailed Working of the System

Working out of the System.
The system is step-by-step and does not involve complicated algorithms to ensure transparency.

# Step 1: Skill Input
The user will input the talents needed in a job position as indicated in the job description.

# Step 2: Confidence Rating
To each skill, the user rates his or her confidence on a scale between 0 and 3. 
This is a honest self-evaluation of the user.

# Step 3: Score Aggregation
There is a total score of each confidence value.
The highest score is determined by the skills required.


# Step 4: Readiness Calculation
The readiness percentage is calculated using:
(total confidence score / maximum possible score) × 100

# Step 5: Decision Making
According to the percentage, the system classifies the user into:
- Ready to apply
- Semi-prepared (preparation is required)
- Not ready yet

This structured flow keeps the logic simple and reliable.
